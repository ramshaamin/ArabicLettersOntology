# Arabic Letters and their Characteristics in Tajweed of Holy Quran
The Holy Quran is the divine words of wisdom by Allah that have been considered and used for fourteen centuries as the primary source of knowledge and guidance for Muslims around the world. The word **Quran** means *"recitation"*, and Muslims throughout the world recite its verses so reciting the Holy Quran with its science of recitation is obligatory for all. The **language** of the Quran is *Arabic* and each Arabic letter in the Quran and has an articulation point from which it originates and have some characteristics.Linguistically, the Arabic word **Tajweed** means *"proﬁciency"* or *"doing something good"*. When applied to the Quran, Tajweed means *the set of rules on how to pronounce the words when the Quran is recited.* SO, pronouncing the Arabic letters with their characteristics for accurate recitation of the Holy Quran is very important. There are **28 alphabets** in Arabic language and each letter has its particular articulation point and is pronounced in its unique way and have its characteristics. The letter characteristics are what distinguishes letters from others that share the same point of articulation. Fig. 1 shows how to conceptual model the relationships between the Arabic letters and their characteristics for the Tajweed domain.

# Tajweed Ontology Version 1.0
The purpose of the Tajweed ontology is to provide a formal and semantic representation that models all the knowledge necessary for the representation of the Arabic letters and their characteristics to study and reason on Quranic text. This semantic representation aims to accomplish the following goals:(1) Determine the rules for each Arabic letter by defining its specific point of articulation. (2) Distinguish the letters coming from the same point of articulation and (3) Determine what is the characteristic of a letter and to which type (strong, medium, weak) it belongs (4) Describe Arabic letters to their particular groups and (5) Reason and infer new knowledge.
